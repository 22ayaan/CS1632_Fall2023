## Description

UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

## Prerequisites

1. Please install the [Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
   or the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

1. Please install the web driver for the browser of your choice.  The
   Selenium people just recently announced a new tool called Selenium
Manager that can automatically download and install a web driver that
matches your current browser.  You can invoke Selenium Manager as
follows, assuming you are using Chrome.  If you want to use Firefox, you can
just replace "chrome" with "firefox" in the instructions.

   On Windows:
   
   ```
   selenium-manager\windows\selenium-manager.exe --browser chrome
   ```

   On MacOS:

   ```
   selenium-manager/macos/selenium-manager --browser chrome
   ```

   On Linux:

   ```
   selenium-manager/linux/selenium-manager --browser chrome
   ```

   On running this tool, you should see something similar to the below:

   ```
   > selenium-manager\windows\selenium-manager.exe --browser chrome
   INFO    Driver path: C:\Users\mrabb\.cache\selenium\chromedriver\win64\116.0.5845.96\chromedriver.exe
   INFO    Browser path: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
   ```

1. Please adding the Selenium IDE browser extension for your web browser by
   selecting "Chrome Download" or "Firefox Download" on the below website:

   https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/

   Then, open Selenium IDE by clicking on the newly created browser extension with
the "Se" symbol.  You should see a pop up window that looks very similar to the
one shown on the lecture slides.
